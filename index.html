            Nearby wildfires are polluting Seattle's skies, diminishing the air quality and prompting <br>
            health effects similar to heavy smoking.
            <br><br>
            Blazing wildfires along the West Coast in places like California and Canada's British Columbia <br>
            are sending smoke and ash into Seattle's air, raising the Air Quality Index to 186 as of Wednesday <br>
            afternoon. A range of 151 to 200 is classified as unhealthy. At that level, people may begin to <br>
            experience health effects. In some parts of the city, the index rose to 201, which is classified <br>
            as very unhealthy.
            <br><br>            
            According to a formula created by Berkeley Earth, an Air Quality Index of 150 is equal to smoking <br>
            about seven cigarettes a day. As of Wednesday morning, Seattle ranked No. 1 on top 10 cities worldwide <br>
            with the worst air quality.
